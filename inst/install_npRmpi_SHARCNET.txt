To account for the heterogeneity of systems in SHARCNET (some of which
are not binary compatible), I install a separate version of R on every
system I wish to use. I do this in my work directory (/work/foo/R and
build R with ./configure --prefix=/work/foo/R) then modify my path in
.bash_profile so that it includes the bin dir /work/foo/R via

export PATH=/work/foo/R/bin:./$PATH

where `foo' is your SHARCNET account username. Now every system I log
on to will have current working version of R and associated packages.

A) To install npRmpi, I first install np in the usual manner (in R
type install.packages("np")) and then install npRmpi. The following
works on brown, angel, goblin, and hound:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/sharcnet/openmpi/current/intel/lib
export MPI_ROOT=/opt/sharcnet/openmpi/current/intel
R CMD INSTALL npRmpi_0.40-0.tar.gz 

and I can run jobs via

sqsub -o foo.out -r 7d -q mpi -n 16 R CMD BATCH --no-save foo.R

B) The following works on saw...

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/openmpi/1.2.5-V00/gcc/lib64/
export MPI_ROOT=/opt/openmpi/1.2.5-V00/gcc
R CMD INSTALL npRmpi_0.40-0.tar.gz --configure-args='--with-mpi=/opt/openmpi/1.2.5-V00/gcc --with-Rmpi-libpath=/opt/openmpi/1.2.5-V00/gcc/lib64 --with-Rmpi-include=/opt/openmpi/1.2.5-V00/gcc/include --with-Rmpi-type=OPENMPI'

and I can run jobs via

sqsub -o foo.out -r 7d -q mpi -n 16 /opt/openmpi/1.2.5-V00/gcc/bin/mpirun -n 16 R CMD BATCH --no-save foo.R

C) I am trying to get something working on whale...

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/sharcnet/openmpi/1.4.2/intel/lib
export MPI_ROOT=/opt/sharcnet/openmpi/1.4.2/intel 
R CMD INSTALL npRmpi_0.40-0.tar.gz --configure-args='--with-mpi=/opt/sharcnet/openmpi/1.4.2/intel --with-Rmpi-libpath=/opt/sharcnet/openmpi/1.4.2/intel/lib --with-Rmpi-include=/opt/sharcnet/openmpi/1.4.2/intel/include --with-Rmpi-type=OPENMPI'
